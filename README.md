# Project Title

## 📌 Overview

This is Week 1 of my first Module: Advanced Node.js & Express.js Backend focusing on Advanced Authentication and Security with Testing Foundations (JEST).

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Implement refresh token mechanisms
- Build role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure applications against common vulnerabilities
- Establish testing habits from the start

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Multi-role authentication system (Admin, User, Moderator)
- User registration with email verification
- OAuth 2.0 login options (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- Admin dashboard with user management
- Password reset functionality
- Secure password policies (bcrypt salt rounds, password rules)
- Input sanitization & validation with `express-validator`
- Rate limiting strategies (per-user, per-endpoint)
- Security middleware (`Helmet.js`, CORS configuration)

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit testing with Jest (auth middleware, utilities)
- Test-driven development workflow
- Mocking external dependencies
- Coverage for authentication & authorization flows

---

## 📝 Expected outcomes for my skills at the end of the module:

- By the end of this project, I expect to:
- Gain confidence in implementing backend security best practices
- Develop stronger habits in modularizing and organizing my codebase
- Improve my ability to write effective unit tests with Jest
- Build a deeper understanding of authentication/authorization flows
- Strengthen my foundation in test-driven development (TDD)
- Be more comfortable with mocking external dependencies
